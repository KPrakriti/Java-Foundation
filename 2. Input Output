1. Public class Main{
   Public static void main(String[] args)
     {
        System.out.prinlt(“Hello world!”);
     }
  }
1. Every program in Java begins with a class definition. Here Main is the name of the class.
2. The name of the class should be same as the file name when that class is public.
3. You cannot have multiple public class - you can have multiple class - but cannot have multiple public class.
4. Public static void main(String[] args) - this is a method
5. Every program must have a main method
6. main method must be inside the class definition

4. Difference between Byte Stream and Character Stream
Ans. ____________________________________________________________
     | Byte Stream              |   Character Stream            |
     ____________________________________________________________
     | 1. Reads 1 byte i.e 8 bit| 1.  Reads 2 byte at a time    |
     |    at a time.            |     i.e 16 bits.              |
     | 2. defined using two     | 2. defined using two abstract | 
     |    class hierarchies     |    classes - reader & writer  |
     |    Input Stream & Output |                               |
     |    Stream                |                               |
