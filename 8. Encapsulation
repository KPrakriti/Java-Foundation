* ENCAPSULATION

It is also known as Information hiding. 
Encapsulation refers to combining data and behaviour
together in one package and hiding the implementation
details from the user of the objects.	

Data is the instance variables that we have for an object.
Example we had employee class and the variables such as 
name , salary are the data.

Behaviour is the methods that are there in the objects.
Example - getSalary() is a behaviour of employee class

Encapsulation example- 
when we use mobile while making a 
Call we just tap the call button and we donâ€™t know what's the 
Implementation behind that button.

ADVANTAGES OF ENCAPSULATION
1.Control of data
2.Easy debugging
3.Data hiding

How do we achieve Encapsulation?
1. A private data field
2. A public accessor method (can only access and return)
3. A public mutator method (can also modify)

Lets see Accessor and Mutator
	class Employee{
	   private String name;
	   private int salary;

	   public int getSalary( ){
		return salary;
	     }

	  public String getName( ){
		return name;
	     }
        }
	
  we kept the variables name and salary private and created
	Public methods to access the name and salary because 
	We do not want any object to modify the name.
	using the public getSalary and getName methods anyone
	can access the name and salary.

	//create a mutator method which modifies the salary
	public int calSalary(){
	     return 500*salary;
	}


MCQS on ENCAPSULATION

Q. Encapsulation is supported by _ _ _ _ _ _.
Ans. Classes

Q. Encapsulation helps in writing  _ _ _ _ classes in java?
Ans. Immutable - it can be created by making the class as final and making all its members private.

Q. How can we achieve Encapsulation in java?
Ans. using access specifiers

Q. Following concept can be used for encapsulation in java programs
Ans. wrapping data fields with methods, using interfaces, hiding data and
Internal methods using access modifiers in a class

Q. which feature can be implemented using encapsulation?
Ans. Abstraction - Data abstraction can be achieved by using encapsulation. We can hide the operation and structure of actual program 
     from the user and can show only required information by the user.

Q. In a class, encapsulating an object of another class is called
Ans. Composition
