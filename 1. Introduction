Q. What is Java?
Ans. Java is a cross platform and object oriented programming language.

Q. What are some features of JAVA?
- Simple programming language
- Portable - when we run a java prog it gives a byte code - this byte code can be run on linux,windows, macOS or anywhere. It is platform independent programming language
- Object oriented - everything is considered as an object - that has some state or behaviour
- Secured - there were issues in some languages with pointers - so when we used pointers the address was accessible which we didn’t want. So such features are removed from java 
- Dynamic - It supports dynamic memory allocation due to which memory wastage is reduced and the performance of application is increased
- Distributed - Java allows us to write different methods which are not connected by each other but still you can access different methods. This make java distributed.
- Robust - strong memory management system and helps in eliminating errors as it checks the code during runtime and compile time
- Multithreaded - It provided multiple threads of execution. Meaning these threads will run parallelly to each other. This decreases the time of program to run.

Q. How is a program is executed in Java?
Ans. First, in Java we have a .java file. This file is given to the javac compiler which converts it to byte code having .class file extension
     After this the byte code is given to the JVM(Java virtual machine). The classes are loaded there and the the bytecode is verified. The file is then given to the
     JIT(just in time) which passes it to the Interpreter where the high level code is converted to the machine level code. Lastly, the interpreter gives this
     machine code to the OS of different platforms like Windows, Linux, MacOS. This is the reason why we can run java code on any platform.
   
Q. Lets see a simple Hello world program
Ans.    Public class Main{                             //Every program in java begins with a class definition. Here Main is class name.The name of the class should be same as the file name when that class is public. You cannot have multiple public class - you can have multiple class - but cannot have multiple public class
          Public static void main(String[] args)       //this is a method. Every program must have a main method. Main method must be inside the class definition
         {
            System.out.prinlt(“Hello world!”);
         }
       }
