1. Variables-
    It is not possible for anyone to remember the address of each data we store. Thus whenever we store data we give it a name (identifier).
    Using datatype Operating system allots memory to store any value. When we assign any value to a variable it is called assignment
    Scope of variable - The part of program in which the variable is accessible is called scope of the program
    Variable names are case sensitive - var1 is different from vAR1 
    Variable name must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign 
    
    
2. Data Type-
    Data types refers to the types of data stored
    There are 8 predefined data types in java called primitive data types 

    Byte - used to declare a byte type variable. It can have values from -128 to 127. It takes 8 bit of memory space
    Short - -32768 to 32767. It takes 16 bit of memory
    Integer : -2^31 to 2^31 - 1. It takes 32 bit of memory space
    Long : -2^63 to 2^63 - 1. It takes 64 bit of memory space
    Float : used to represent decimal numbers. It is precise till approx 6 digits after decimal. Default value is 0.0f
    Double : used to represent decimal numbers. It is precise till approx 15 digits after decimal. Default value is 0.0. By default all decimal literals are of double type
    Boolean - used to declare only two values - true and false. Default value is false.
    Character data types - keyword char is used. Size is 2 bytes. Stored as Ascii values(meaning in forms of characters) in memory. ASCII stands for american standard code for information interchange.
    Char occupies 16-bit in memory in java, so it supports 2^16 i:e from 0 to 65535

    So when we write char ch = ‘A’ – in memory A’s ascii value will be store i.e 65
      0 starts with 48
      a starts with 65
      A starts with 97


3. Keywords-
    Keywords are the predefined words - that have special meaning to the compiler. 
    Example - int, float, boolean, char, float these all are keywords
    More example - abstract, access, private, public, protected, extends - these are all keywords too
    The keywords cannot be used as identifiers
    
4. Identifiers-
    Identifiers are the names given to the variables, methods 
    Identifiers cannot be the keywords 
    Identifiers are basically the variable name we use
    
5. Operators 
   Types of operators
    Arithmetic
    Assignment
    Relational
    Logical
    Unary - increment and decrement operators
    Bitwise operator
    
6. Arithmetic Operators 
    These include addition (+) , subtraction (-), Multiplication (*) , Division (/) , Modulo (%). 
    These are binary operators meaning it requires 2 operands to work upon

    Division - when we use a division operator with two integers the output is also integer type.
    If one of the numerator or denominator is of floating type then the output is also of floating type

    Int b = 5.0/2 will give an error because we are storing double in integer which is not possible. Note that all decimal by default in java are of double type 

    Double b = 5.0/2 – this is correct
    Float b = 5.0/2 — wrong. 
    Float b = 5.0f / 2 — correct
