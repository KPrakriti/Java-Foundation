Q. What is Java?
Ans. Java is a cross platform and object oriented programming language.

Q. What are some features of JAVA?
- Simple programming language
- Portable - when we run a java prog it gives a byte code - this byte code can be run on linux,windows, macOS or anywhere. It is platform independent programming language
- Object oriented - everything is considered as an object - that has some state or behaviour
- Secured - there were issues in some languages with pointers - so when we used pointers the address was accessible which we didnâ€™t want. So such features are removed from java 
- Dynamic - It supports dynamic memory allocation due to which memory wastage is reduced and the performance of application is increased
- Distributed - Java allows us to write different methods which are not connected by each other but still you can access different methods. This make java distributed.
- Robust - strong memory management system and helps in eliminating errors as it checks the code during runtime and compile time
- Multithreaded - It provided multiple threads of execution. Meaning these threads will run parallelly to each other. This decreases the time of program to run.

Q. How is a program is executed in Java?
Ans. First, in Java we have a .java file. This file is given to the javac compiler which converts it to byte code having .class file extension
     After this the byte code is given to the JVM(Java virtual machine). The classes are loaded there and the the bytecode is verified. The file is then given to the
     JIT(just in time) which passes it to the Interpreter where the high level code is converted to the machine level code. Lastly, the interpreter gives this
     machine code to the OS of different platforms like Windows, Linux, MacOS. This is the reason why we can run java code on any platform.
   
Q. Some points to remember -
     1. Objects are stored in heap area of memory.
     2. JDK includes everything - its the whole package
     3. JRE is the implementation of JVM, it provides platform to execute java programs.
     4. JIT optimises bytecode to machine specific language code by compiling similar bytecodes at same time.This reduces overall time taken for compilation of bytecode to machine specific language.
     5.Compiler does the task of converting code in high level languages to platform independent code.
     6.JAR stands for Java ARchive. It's a file format based on the popular ZIP file format and is used for aggregating many files into one. Although JAR can be used as a general archiving tool, the primary motivation for its development was so that Java applets and their requisite components 
     7. Java is not a Low level language
