1. Public class Main{
   Public static void main(String[] args)
     {
        System.out.prinlt(“Hello world!”);
     }
  }
1. Every program in Java begins with a class definition. Here Main is the name of the class.
2. The name of the class should be same as the file name when that class is public.
3. You cannot have multiple public class - you can have multiple class - but cannot have multiple public class.
4. Public static void main(String[] args) - this is a method
5. Every program must have a main method
6. main method must be inside the class definition


2. JAVA performs the Input Outpur through streams- 

3. What do you mean by streams?
Ans. Flow of data from where you can read or write to. 
      Streams can be of TWO types. 
      1. Byte Stream
      2. Character Stream
      
4. Difference between Byte Stream and Character Stream
Ans. ____________________________________________________________
     | Byte Stream              |   Character Stream            |
     ____________________________________________________________
     | 1. Reads 1 byte i.e 8 bit| 1.  Reads 2 byte at a time    |
     |    at a time.            |     i.e 16 bits.              |
     | 2. defined using two     | 2. defined using two abstract | 
     |    class hierarchies     |    classes - reader & writer  |
     |    Input Stream & Output |                               |
     |    Stream                |                               |

5. What is system class?
Ans. it is a predefined class. It contains functionalities like in, out, err.

6. In how many ways we can read input?
Ans. There are two ways in whcih you can read input - 
     1. using Scanner
     2. using bufferReader
     
     
7. How do we read input from the bufferReader?
Ans. The bufferReader belongs to the Character Stream
     BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))
     
     The Bufferedreader accespts character stream 
     but the System.in takes the byte input
     
     The InputStreamReader converts the byte stream to charcter stream and then the data is given to the BufferedReader
     
     BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
     String read = br.readLine(); //reads a line
     String readd = br.read(); //reads a character

    
8. How do we read input from the Scanner?
Ans.  Scanner class is defined in Java.util package. So, whenever we need to use the Scanner class we have to import it first using import java.util.Scanner;
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(system.in);
      int n = sc.nextInt(); //for taking integer input
      String s = sc.nextLine(); //for taking string input
      Float f = sc.nextFloat(); 
      Boolean b = sc.nextBoolean();
      Long l = sc.nextLongInt();
      Double d = sc.nextDouble();
      
      Notice when you use int n = sc.nextInt() and suppose you have 4 as input 
      In the next line you want to take an input string so you wrote -
      String s = sc.nextLine(); 
      The user gave an input but the result you will see in output screen would be 
      o/p : 4
           —-- //blank line 
      This happened because String s = sc.nextLine(); this statement consumed emptyline/new line as an input and printed that. 
      So anytime you want to print any string after an int, float, double – use sc.nextLine twice - one to consume the newline and one to consume the actual string input!


9. Difference between Scanner and Buffered Reader
   ______________________________________________________________________
   |Scanner                       | Buffered Reader                     |
   ______________________________________________________________________
   |1. Not synchronous            |1. Synchronous                       |
   ______________________________________________________________________
   |2. Should be used only in     |2. Should be used in multithreaded   | 
   |   single threaded case       |   case                              |
   ______________________________________________________________________
   |3. little buffer of 1 kb char |3. large buffer of 8 kb byte buffer  |
   |   char buffer                |                                     |
   ______________________________________________________________________
   |4. Scanner is bit slower as   |4. Buffered reader is faster as it   |
   |   it needs to parse data     |   only reads character stream       |
   ______________________________________________________________________
   |5. It has methods like        |5. It has methods like parseInt()    |
   |   nextint(),nextShort() etc  |   parseShort() etc                  |
   ______________________________________________________________________
   |6. Scanner has method         |6. It has methods readLine()         |
   |   nextLine() to read a line  |   to read a line                    |
